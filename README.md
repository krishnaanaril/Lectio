# Lectio

Lectio is a progressive web application which helps to read machine recognisable text from images. It supports more than 60 languages.

It is based on the javascript library [tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js). There are few performance issues due to the loading of heavy trained data for each language. I need to check whether there is better way to handle this.
